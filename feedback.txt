Tatiana: chat bot that gives advice about missels atacks depending on the city
The project is well structured and the code is clean and easy to follow, using OOP as well.
The connection to the db is made in a separate file, which makes it reusable and that's great
Good use of datetime module. 
The data about the atacks history is made through API and JSON.
It is a really good project, I just wish it was working in the deadline for the Hackathon.
